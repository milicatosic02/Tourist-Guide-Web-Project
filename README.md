# Tourist Guide  

## Project Overview  
The **RAF Tourist Guide** is an online platform that allows users to explore and discover travel destinations worldwide.  
The system is divided into two main parts:  

1. **Content Management System (CMS)** â€“ requires authentication and provides role-based access:  
   - **Content Editor** â€“ can create, edit, view, and delete tourist articles.  
   - **Administrator** â€“ has all editor privileges, plus user management (adding, editing, activating/deactivating users).  

2. **Public Tourist Guide Platform** â€“ open to all visitors, providing access to articles and destinations:  
   - Browse published articles by **destination** or **activity**  
   - View **most popular articles** in the last 30 days  
   - Read full articles with author details, publication date, activities, and comments  
   - Leave and view comments on articles  
   - Track article visits and popularity
